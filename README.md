# arch-distrobox

Arch image designed for use in distrobox. This image includes all of the packages normally installed by distrobox on first start, [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) pre-installed, and a modified [xdg-utils](https://github.com/KyleGospo/xdg-utils-distrobox-arch) that allows the container to open your host operating system's web browsers and file explorer.
